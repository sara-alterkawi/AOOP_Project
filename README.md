AOOP_Project
The objective of this project is to design and develop a Java-based tile-based puzzle game, Sokoban, that incorporates the MVC design patterns. The game is intended to provide an enjoyable user experience through the use of various repluggable methods of control, including keyboard through the provision of multiple views of the game. We discusses the process of designing and implementing the game, including considerations of functionality, design, implementation, and testing. It also highlights the unique aspects of the program and how it differs from similar applications.
